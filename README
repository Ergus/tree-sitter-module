I should clarify that this module is NOT a standalone tree-sitter
module. It is supposed to be used with an upcoming tree-sitter
integration in Emacs core.

To build the language definition for a particular language, run

    ./build.sh <language>

e.g.,

    ./build.sh html

The dynamic module will be in dist directory

To build all modules at once, run

    ./batch.sh

This gives you C, JSON, Go, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python, Typescript
(tsx), C# (csharp), C++ (cpp), Rust, etc, etc. More can be added to
batch.sh unless its directory structure is not standard.

You can enable parallel build with JOBS variable, like this:

    JOBS=8 ./batch.sh
